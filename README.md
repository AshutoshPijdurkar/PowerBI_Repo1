What I Did:
I created dashboard to help understand COVID-19 data better. I used Power BI to make charts and maps that show how cases and deaths have changed over  time and  across different countries.
Main Goals:

Track-Changes:See how COVID-19 cases and deaths went up or down in different areas
Spot-Patterns:Find any noticeable increases or decreases in cases
Weekly-Trends:Show the average number of cases and deaths each week
Country-Data:See the number of cases in each country, with a filter to check by month
World-Map:Made a map to see which areas were hit hardest byCOVID-19
WHO-Regions:Created a list showing which WHO regions and countries were most affected

How I Did It:
I made at least 5 different charts and put them all together on one dashboard. Then I uploaded everything to GitHub and shared the link

Tools Used: Power BI
